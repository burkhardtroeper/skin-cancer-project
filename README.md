# BR skin-cancer-project
Every year, about 293,000 people in Germany are diagnosed with a form of skin cancer. Approximately 35,000 people are diagnosed with the particularly dangerous malignant melanoma, also known as "black skin cancer". The prognosis of the disease depends crucially on the time of diagnosis. The sooner a skin cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances of cure.

The cooperation of those affected plays a major role. People who bear a higher risk for the disease should check their skin regularly (once a month, for example) for changes and consult a dermatologist quickly if they notice any abnormalities. The distinction between a harmless birthmark and skin cancer can only be made by specialists - so far.  

Algorithms from the field of machine learning and the availability of data on skin cancer - in the form of photos of classified skin cancer cases - make it possible to create models with which even laypersons can obtain an initial assessment of a skin change. Simply by photographing the area on the skin and sending it to the model for analysis. At least this is the assumption.

The aim of this part of the "BR Skin Cancer Project" is to generate such a model. The corresponding app, with which photos can be taken for an analysis, will be created in another part of the "BR Skin Cancer Project".

The "BR Skin Cancer Project" is just a demonstration of the possibilities. The model and the app will not be suitable for real evaluations of skin changes.

The project and reports are written in german.
