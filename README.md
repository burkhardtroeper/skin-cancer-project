# skin-cancer-project
The aim of this part of the "BR Skin Cancer Project" is to generate a model to predict skin cancer from photos taken from the skin. Model generation is done with a CNN(Keras) and the Skin-Cancer-MNIST-Data. The corresponding app, with which photos can be taken for an analysis, will be created in another part of the "BR Skin Cancer Project".
